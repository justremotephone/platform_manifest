This is a current AOSP build with minimal changes needed for our good old HTC Desire (BRAVO).

Original BRAVO sources are from http://evervolv.com.

The minimal change set should allow fast rebases on top of future android releases.

Following works:

- WIFI
- BLUETOOTH
- RADIO (may need some time after reboot to connect)
- ....

Not working:

- Camera
- Multimedia codecs

WARNING: Because of limited internal storage of the HTC Desire this build needs an external SD-CARD partition as internal data partition.

To use the internal data partition revert commit: https://github.com/justremotephone/android_device_htc_bravo/commit/df861492d0ce2162d897a3bb4c0cef6abac091fd
